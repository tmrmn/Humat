HUMAT was developed as a basic architecture for constructing artificial populations, in which agent cognitions, decision-making and social interactions are based on social scientific theory. Real world social dynamics, such as social innovations, opinion dynamics and behavioural transitions involve the behaviour and communication of many different individuals connected in social networks, who make decisions on their behaviours on the basis of their interests, share information with others, and are susceptible to norms. They are repeatedly confronted with difficult choices, as trade-offs are often made between short term gratification, social impacts of choices and personal values. Interactions between individuals result in a diffusion of new behaviours, formation of opposite opinion groups, and emergence of tipping points giving dominance to particular norms.
