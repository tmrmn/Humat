HUMAT was developed as a basic architecture for constructing artificial populations, in which agent
cognitions, decision-making and social interactions are based on social scientific theory. Real world
social dynamics, such as social innovations, opinion dynamics and behavioural transitions (e.g. Nyborg
et al. 2016) involve the behaviour and communication of many different individuals connected in social
networks, who make decisions on their behaviours on the basis of their interests, share information
with others, and are susceptible to norms. They are repeatedly confronted with difficult choices, as
trade-offs are often made between short term gratification, social impacts of choices and personal
values. Interactions between individuals result in a diffusion of new behaviours, formation of opposite
opinion groups, and emergence of tipping points giving dominance to particular norms.
